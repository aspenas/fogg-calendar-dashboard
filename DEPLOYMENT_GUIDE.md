## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Frontend (React)** - Beautiful dashboard interface
2. **Serverless Functions** - Handle deployment logic (no server needed!)
3. **Netlify Hosting** - Automatic HTTPS, global CDN, zero configuration
4. **Real-time Updates** - Polls status every 2 seconds during deployment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check that Node.js version is 18+ in build settings
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json

### Functions Don't Work
- Ensure functions are in `netlify/functions/` folder
- Check function logs in Netlify dashboard

### Deployment Seems Stuck
- Refresh the page - it might have completed
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

## 📞 Support

If you need help:
1. **Check the Netlify build logs** in your site dashboard
2. **Try refreshing the page** - sometimes it just needs a reload
3. **Contact Patrick** - He can help troubleshoot any issues
