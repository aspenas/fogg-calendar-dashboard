# FOGG Calendar Dashboard - Debugging Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. SSL Certificate Problem ‚ùå
- **Domain**: `https://fogg.candlefish.ai`  
- **Issue**: SSL certificate only covers `*.netlify.app`, not `fogg.candlefish.ai`
- **Error**: "Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames"
- **Impact**: Users can't access the dashboard securely

### 2. Netlify Functions Not Deployed ‚ùå
- **URLs Tested**: 
  - `/.netlify/functions/deploy` ‚Üí 404
  - `/.netlify/functions/status` ‚Üí 404
  - `/.netlify/functions/health` ‚Üí 404
- **Issue**: Functions exist in repository but aren't deployed to Netlify
- **Impact**: Dashboard can't start deployments (backend broken)

### 3. Frontend/Backend Communication Broken ‚ùå
- **Cause**: API endpoints returning 404
- **Impact**: Purple "Update Calendar Now" button won't work
- **Impact**: Sync functionality completely broken

## Working Solution Discovered ‚úÖ

The dashboard is actually deployed and working at:
**https://fogg-calendar.netlify.app/**

### Verified Working Features:
- ‚úÖ Site loads with HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Purple "Update Calendar Now" button visible
- ‚úÖ Friendly agent helpers (Guardian üõ°Ô∏è, Speedster ‚ö°, Detective üîç, Architect üèóÔ∏è)
- ‚úÖ Functions tested locally and work correctly

### Functions Status:
```bash
# Local testing confirms functions work:
‚úÖ deploy.js - Returns version 2.4.1, status ready
‚úÖ status.js - Handles deployment polling
‚úÖ health.js - System health monitoring
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Netlify Deployment Configuration
The repository is connected to Netlify but the functions aren't being deployed. Possible causes:

1. **Build Configuration**: Functions directory not properly configured
2. **Deployment Hook**: Recent push didn't trigger function deployment
3. **Netlify Site Settings**: Functions may be disabled or misconfigured
4. **Build Process**: Functions build step may be failing silently

### Secondary Issue: DNS/SSL Configuration
The custom domain `fogg.candlefish.ai` is configured in Netlify but:
- SSL certificate not properly provisioned
- DNS may not be pointing correctly
- Certificate doesn't include the custom domain

## Immediate Fix for User

**Use this URL instead**: https://fogg-calendar.netlify.app/

This URL:
- ‚úÖ Has valid SSL certificate
- ‚úÖ Should have working functions (once deployment completes)
- ‚úÖ All frontend features work
- ‚úÖ No security warnings

## Technical Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Fix Function Deployment
The functions need to be deployed to Netlify. Options:
1. **Manual Redeploy**: Trigger manual deployment in Netlify dashboard
2. **Push Update**: Make minor code change and push to trigger build
3. **Netlify CLI**: Use `netlify deploy` command if available

### Step 2: Fix SSL/DNS (Lower Priority)
1. **Verify DNS**: Ensure `fogg.candlefish.ai` CNAME points to `fogg-calendar.netlify.app`
2. **Renew SSL**: Force SSL certificate renewal in Netlify dashboard  
3. **Alternative**: Update documentation to use working URL

## Testing Checklist

Once functions are deployed, verify:

```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl -f "https://fogg-calendar.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/deploy"
curl -f "https://fogg-calendar.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/status?deploymentId=test&startTime=2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"

# Test dashboard functionality
1. Visit https://fogg-calendar.netlify.app/
2. Click purple "Update Calendar Now" button
3. Verify agents show progress animation
4. Confirm deployment completes with confetti
```

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Frontend: Working
- ‚úÖ Local Functions: Working
- ‚ùå Deployed Functions: Not working (404s)
- ‚ùå Custom Domain SSL: Not working
- ‚úÖ Netlify Default Domain: Working

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Direct users to `https://fogg-calendar.netlify.app/`
2. **Fix Functions**: Investigate Netlify deployment configuration
3. **Fix SSL**: Resolve custom domain certificate issue
4. **Test**: Verify all functionality works end-to-end
5. **Document**: Update user instructions with correct URL

## Impact Assessment

**User Impact**: 
- Dashboard completely inaccessible via intended URL
- Sync functionality broken
- Users likely seeing error messages

**Business Impact**:
- FOGG calendar updates not possible
- Leslie can't perform scheduled updates
- System appears completely broken to end users

**Technical Debt**:
- Custom domain configuration incomplete
- Deployment pipeline has gaps
- No monitoring of function availability

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Use working Netlify URL
2. **Short-term**: Fix function deployment 
3. **Long-term**: Set up monitoring and proper DNS configuration
4. **Process**: Add deployment verification to CI/CD pipeline

---

**Summary**: Dashboard exists and works, but is deployed at wrong URL with broken functions. Quick fix is to use the Netlify URL while resolving the deployment configuration issues.
