## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (Recommended for Leslie)
1. Click the "Deploy to Netlify" button in README.md
2. Connect GitHub account
3. Name the site (e.g., "fogg-calendar-dashboard")
4. Click "Save & Deploy"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for build completion
6. Test the deployed URL

### Option 2: Manual Netlify Deploy
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign in
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 3: Netlify CLI Deploy
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy from project directory
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
In Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables:
```
VITE_DEFAULT_USER=Leslie
VITE_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_ENABLE_CONFETTI=true
VITE_POLLING_INTERVAL=2000
```

### Custom Domain (Optional)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify these features work:

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] All four agent cards display correctly
- [ ] Current version shows properly
- [ ] Status indicators work
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Function Testing
- [ ] GET /api/deploy returns status
- [ ] POST /api/deploy starts deployment
- [ ] GET /api/status returns progress
- [ ] CORS headers allow cross-origin requests
- [ ] Error handling shows user-friendly messages

### User Experience Testing
- [ ] Deploy button clickable and responsive
- [ ] Progress bar animates smoothly
- [ ] Agent status updates in real-time
- [ ] Success confetti displays (if enabled)
- [ ] Error states show helpful messages
- [ ] Page refresh works correctly

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Load Times
- Initial page load: < 2 seconds
- Subsequent visits: < 1 second (cached)
- Function response time: < 500ms

### Bundle Sizes
- Total bundle: ~280kb (compressed)
- Vendor chunk: ~140kb (React, Framer Motion)
- App code: ~8kb
- Styles: ~6kb

## 🔒 Security Features

- [x] HTTPS enforced automatically
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] XSS protection enabled
- [x] Content type sniffing disabled
- [x] Frame options set to DENY
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] No sensitive data in client code

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Fails
- **Issue**: Dependencies not found
- **Solution**: Verify package.json has all required dependencies
- **Check**: Node.js version is 18+ in build settings

### Functions Don't Work
- **Issue**: API calls return 404
- **Solution**: Ensure functions are in `netlify/functions/` folder
- **Check**: Function names match URL paths

### Slow Loading
- **Issue**: Large bundle sizes
- **Solution**: Code splitting already implemented
- **Check**: Enable gzip compression (automatic on Netlify)

### CORS Errors
- **Issue**: API calls blocked by browser
- **Solution**: Functions already include proper CORS headers
- **Check**: Verify headers in function responses

## 📞 Support Contacts

### For Leslie (End User)
- **Primary**: Text Patrick for any issues
- **Backup**: Refresh page and try again
- **Emergency**: Use previous calendar system if needed

### For Developers
- **Build Logs**: Netlify dashboard → Site → Deploys
- **Function Logs**: Netlify dashboard → Functions → View logs
- **Analytics**: Netlify dashboard → Analytics
- **Support**: Netlify support chat (for hosting issues)

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Deployment is considered successful when:
- [x] Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds
- [x] Deploy button triggers deployment simulation
- [x] Progress updates every 2 seconds
- [x] Agent status changes appropriately
- [x] Success state shows confetti
- [x] Error states display helpful messages
- [x] Mobile experience is smooth
